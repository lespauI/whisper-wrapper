## Architecture Decisions

The architecture for the Whisper Wrapper application is designed with the following key principles:

1. **Local-First**: The application runs entirely on the user's machine, with no server dependencies except for the OpenAI API.

2. **Modular Design**: Components are organized into clear layers with well-defined responsibilities.

3. **Extensibility**: The architecture allows for future enhancements, such as live transcription.

4. **User Experience**: The design prioritizes a smooth, intuitive user experience with responsive feedback.

5. **Maintainability**: Code organization and documentation are structured to facilitate maintenance and future development.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach, starting with the core functionality (file upload and transcription) and progressively adding features (recording, editing, UI refinement). This allows for incremental delivery and testing of key features.

## Technology Choices

- **Electron**: Provides a cross-platform desktop application framework
- **Node.js**: Offers a robust JavaScript runtime for the backend
- **Web Audio API**: Enables audio recording capabilities
- **FFmpeg**: Provides audio/video processing capabilities
- **OpenAI Whisper API**: Delivers high-quality speech-to-text transcription

## Next Steps

1. Set up the project structure as outlined in the [Project Structure](./project-structure.md) document
2. Implement the core functionality according to the [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md)
3. Follow the technical requirements specified in the [Technical Requirements](./technical-requirements.md) document
4. Refer to the [Component Diagram](./component-diagram.md) for detailed component design
