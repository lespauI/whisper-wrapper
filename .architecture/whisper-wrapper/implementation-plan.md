| Performance issues with large files | Medium | High | Implement file chunking, progress indicators |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Use polyfills, test across browsers |
| Audio capture limitations | High | Medium | Provide fallback options, clear user guidance |
| Security concerns with API keys | High | Low | Use secure local storage, environment variables |

## Success Criteria

- Application successfully transcribes uploaded audio and video files
- Recording functionality works reliably
- Transcription results are displayed in Markdown format
- Users can edit and download transcription results
- UI is intuitive and visually appealing
- Application runs locally without requiring server deployment

## Conclusion
