## Input Block Repositioning to Settings Panel

### Change Overview:
Moved the "Input" block (containing audio level indicator and waveform visualization) from the bottom right of the recording status panel to the top right corner of the "Recording Settings" panel.

### Rationale:
1. **Better Space Utilization**: Utilizes previously empty space in the Recording Settings area
2. **Logical Grouping**: Groups all input-related elements together with other recording settings
3. **Cleaner Interface**: Creates a more organized and intuitive user experience
4. **Settings Consolidation**: All recording configuration elements now in one cohesive panel

### Implementation Details:

#### HTML Structure Changes:
- **Moved from**: `.record-main-area` container 
- **Moved to**: `.record-settings` container (top section)
- **Added class**: `.audio-corner-settings` for specific positioning within settings panel

#### CSS Positioning Updates:

```css
.record-settings {
    position: relative; /* Enable absolute positioning for child elements */
}

.audio-corner-settings {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0.5rem;
    right: 0.5rem;
    z-index: 10;
    min-width: 280px;
    max-width: 300px;
}

.record-settings h4 {
    margin-right: 300px; /* Leave space for audio corner panel */
}
```

#### Responsive Design:
- **Desktop**: Audio panel floats in top-right corner of settings
- **Mobile**: Reverts to normal flow between title and settings rows
- **Settings title**: Adjusts margin to prevent overlap on desktop

### Benefits:

#### Organization:
- **Logical flow**: Input monitoring with input settings
- **Consolidated controls**: All recording configuration in one panel
- **Reduced clutter**: Eliminates separate monitoring section

#### User Experience:
- **Intuitive placement**: Users expect input controls with input settings
- **Space efficiency**: Better utilization of available screen real estate
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear separation between settings and recording actions

#### Layout Structure:
```
Recording Settings Panel:
├── Title: "Recording Settings" (left)
├── Audio Input Panel (top-right corner)
│   ├── Input Level Meter
│   └── Audio Waveform Visualization
├── Settings Row 1: Quality, Format, Auto-transcribe
└── Settings Row 2: Ongoing transcription, Chunk duration
```

### Technical Implementation:

#### Positioning Strategy:
- **Absolute positioning** within relative-positioned settings container
- **Z-index management** to ensure proper layering
- **Responsive breakpoints** for mobile adaptation
- **Margin adjustments** to prevent content overlap

#### File Changes:
- **HTML**: `/src/renderer/index.html` - Moved audio corner panel to settings
- **CSS**: `/src/renderer/styles/main.css` - Added settings-specific positioning

#### Compatibility:
- **Cross-browser support** maintained with standard CSS
- **Mobile responsiveness** preserved with media queries
- **Accessibility** maintained with proper semantic structure

This repositioning creates a more logical and organized interface where input-related controls are grouped together in the settings panel, improving the overall user experience and interface cleanliness.
