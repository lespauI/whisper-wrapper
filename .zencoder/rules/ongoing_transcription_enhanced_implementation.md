## Enhanced Ongoing Transcription - Advanced Implementation

### Problem Addressed:
Real-time chunk-based transcription suffered from fragmented, inaccurate results due to:
- No context between chunks
- Word/sentence boundaries cut by chunk timing
- Isolated 5-second segments losing conversational flow

### Solution: Overlapping Chunks + Context Accumulation

#### Core Strategy:
1. **Overlapping Chunks**: Chunks overlap by 2 seconds (5s chunks every 3s)
2. **Context History**: Last 2-3 chunks provide context for new transcriptions
3. **Smart Deduplication**: Removes repeated content from overlapping regions
4. **Progressive Building**: Incrementally builds coherent transcription

#### Technical Implementation:

**Chunk Timing**:
- Default: 5-second chunks with 2-second overlap
- Start next chunk after 3 seconds (5s - 2s overlap)
- Continuous overlapping stream instead of sequential chunks

**Context System**:
- `contextHistory[]`: Stores last 3 chunks with metadata
- `buildTranscriptionContext()`: Creates context string from recent chunks
- `transcribeWithContext()`: Enhanced transcription with context awareness

**Deduplication Algorithm**:
- `deduplicateChunkText()`: Compares new chunk with previous chunk end
- Word-level overlap detection (up to 10 words)
- Text similarity scoring (80%+ threshold for overlap detection)
- Removes duplicate portions while preserving new content

**State Management**:
```javascript
ongoingTranscription: {
    chunkDuration: 5,          // Chunk length
    overlapDuration: 2,        // Overlap length
    contextHistory: [],        // Recent chunks for context
    lastChunkText: '',         // For deduplication
    transcriptionText: '',     // Accumulated result
    chunkStartTime: null       // Timing reference
}
```

#### Key Methods:

1. **startOngoingTranscriptionChunk()**: 
   - Creates overlapping MediaRecorder instances
   - Schedules next chunk before current ends

2. **processTranscriptionChunk()**:
   - Builds context from recent chunks
   - Transcribes with context awareness
   - Deduplicates overlapping content
   - Updates accumulated transcription

3. **deduplicateChunkText()**:
   - Finds word-level overlaps between chunks
   - Removes repeated content intelligently
   - Handles Russian language patterns

4. **buildTranscriptionContext()**:
   - Provides recent transcription history as context
   - Limits to 2 previous chunks to avoid confusion

#### User Interface:
- Updated chunk duration options with descriptive labels
- "Uses overlapping chunks for better accuracy" hint
- Console logging for debugging overlap/deduplication

#### Expected Improvements:
- **Better Sentence Flow**: Overlapping captures word boundaries
- **Contextual Accuracy**: Previous chunks inform current transcription
- **Reduced Fragmentation**: Deduplication prevents repetition
- **Progressive Quality**: Each chunk builds on previous context

#### Configuration:
- **Overlap Duration**: 2 seconds (40% of 5s chunks)
- **Context Window**: Last 2-3 chunks
- **Deduplication Threshold**: 80% word similarity
- **Maximum Overlap Check**: 10 words

### Real-world Impact:
Instead of: "Сейчас вы... взрывчаткой... кто построил..."
Expected: "Сейчас вы узнаете, когда в Антарктиде росли джунгли, как киты снабжали весь мир взрывчаткой, кто построил церковь в Антарктиде..."

This implementation bridges the gap between real-time feedback and transcription accuracy.
