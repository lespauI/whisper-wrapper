## Ongoing Translation Phase 2 Implementation Complete

### Completed UI Components (Sprint 2)

#### 1. Translation Controls UI (`src/renderer/index.html` + `src/renderer/index.js`)
- **Purpose**: Provide user controls for enabling/configuring ongoing translation mode
- **Key Features**:
  - "Record with Transcript" checkbox toggle for translation mode
  - Source language dropdown with auto-detect option (11 languages supported)
  - Target language dropdown (10 languages supported)
  - Show/hide logic for language controls based on checkbox state
  - Integrated into existing recording tab settings section
  - CSS styling with responsive design for mobile/tablet
  - Event handlers for checkbox and dropdown changes

#### 2. Live Translation Display (`src/renderer/index.html` + `src/renderer/styles/main.css`)
- **Purpose**: Real-time dual-pane display for original and translated text
- **Key Features**:
  - Side-by-side dual-pane layout (original left, translated right)
  - Real-time sentence segment rendering with dynamic updates
  - Status indicators for different processing states (transcribed, translating, translated, error)
  - Auto-scrolling functionality to show latest content
  - Copy functionality for both original and translated text
  - Clear button to reset translation display
  - Responsive design: stacked layout on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
  - Smooth animations for new sentences and status changes
  - Color-coded sentence segments based on processing state

#### 3. Translation Method Integration (`src/renderer/index.js`)
- **Purpose**: Connect UI controls to translation functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - setupTranslation() method for initializing translation UI controls
  - setupTranslationControls() method called from recording setup
  - toggleTranslationMode() for enabling/disabling translation
  - updateSourceLanguageDisplay() and updateTargetLanguageDisplay() for UI updates
  - addSentenceToDisplay() and updateSentenceInDisplay() for real-time content updates
  - Copy text functionality (copyOriginalText, copyTranslatedText)
  - Clear display functionality (clearTranslationDisplay)

  - Smooth transitions and animations
  - Loading animations for translating state
  - Responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet
  - Accessibility-friendly color schemes and typography

### Integration Points
- Translation controls integrate seamlessly into existing recording tab
- Uses established service layer patterns for OngoingTranslationService integration
- Maintains consistent styling with existing UI components
- Event-driven updates for real-time translation display
- Compatible with existing recording workflow and state management

### UI State Management
- Translation settings stored in app state (enabled, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage)
- Translation session state tracking (segments, pendingTranslations)
- Live translation display visibility controlled by translation mode checkbox
- Language display labels update automatically when selections change

### Next Phase
Phase 3 will focus on:
- Service integration and event handling
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization and testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- User acceptance testing

### Technical Implementation
- HTML structure follows semantic markup patterns
- CSS uses BEM-like naming conventions for maintainability
- JavaScript uses ES6+ features with proper error handling
- Event handlers use defensive programming with null checks
- UI components designed for extensibility and maintenance
