## Ongoing Translation Phase 3 Implementation Complete

### Completed Error Handling System (Sprint 3)

#### 1. ErrorHandlingService (`src/services/errorHandlingService.js`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive error handling, recovery strategies, and user notifications
- **Key Features**:
  - Circuit breaker pattern implementation with automatic timeout and recovery
  - Intelligent error categorization (connection, service_unavailable, resource, permission, format, configuration)
  - Multiple recovery strategies (retry, fallback, reduce_quality, skip, reconfigure)
  - Exponential backoff retry logic with configurable delays
  - Fallback mode activation/deactivation with automatic reset
  - Error statistics tracking per service (transcription, translation, audio)
  - Event-driven error notification system
  - Graceful degradation strategies for different error types

#### 2. NotificationSystem (`src/renderer/notificationSystem.js`)
- **Purpose**: User-friendly error notifications and status updates for the UI
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time error notification display with categorized styling
  - Fallback mode indicator with retry functionality
  - Circuit breaker status notifications
  - Technical details toggle for advanced users
  - Auto-hide notifications with configurable duration
  - Action buttons for error recovery (retry, take action)
  - Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
  - Accessibility-compliant with ARIA labels and screen reader support

#### 3. IPC Communication Enhancement (`src/main/ipcHandlers.js` + `src/main/preload.js`)
- **Purpose**: Bridge error handling between main and renderer processes
- **Key Features**:
  - Error handling IPC methods (getErrorStats, clearErrorStats, retryTranslation)
  - Ongoing translation control methods (start, stop, status)
  - Fallback mode control methods (enable/disable)
  - Real-time error notification forwarding from main to renderer
  - Event listeners for error notifications, circuit breaker states, fallback mode changes
  - Secure IPC exposure through contextBridge

#### 4. OngoingTranslationService Integration
- **Purpose**: Integrated error handling throughout the translation pipeline
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive error handling in transcription and translation processes
  - Error recovery with context-aware retry attempts
  - Service-specific error statistics and monitoring
  - Fallback mode management (manual and automatic)
  - Failed translation retry mechanism
  - Error forwarding to notification system
  - Graceful degradation that continues recording even during service failures

### Error Handling Strategies

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic service protection with configurable failure thresholds
- Half-open state for testing service recovery
- Timeout-based automatic retry attempts
- Per-service circuit breaker tracking

#### Recovery Strategies
1. **Retry**: Exponential backoff with max delay limits
2. **Fallback**: Switch to transcription-only mode
3. **Reduce Quality**: Lower processing quality to improve reliability
4. **Skip**: Continue with next operation for format errors
5. **Reconfigure**: Reset to default settings for configuration errors

#### User Experience
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Visual indicators for different processing states
- Fallback mode display with retry options
- Technical details available for advanced troubleshooting
- Non-disruptive error notifications that don't block workflow

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing OngoingTranslationService
- Event-driven architecture maintains loose coupling
- UI notifications integrate with existing design patterns
- Error handling doesn't affect normal recording functionality
- Maintains session continuity during service failures

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead during normal operation
- Error handling only activates during failure scenarios
- Efficient retry mechanisms prevent resource waste
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Memory-efficient error statistics tracking

### Next Phase
Phase 4 will focus on:
- Session storage and bilingual export functionality
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- User acceptance testing and feedback integration
- Documentation and deployment preparation

### Technical Specifications
- Error categorization covers all major failure types
- Recovery strategies tested for different error scenarios
- Circuit breaker thresholds optimized for real-time use
- Notification system handles high-frequency error events
- IPC communication secured and performance-optimized
- Error logging provides sufficient debugging context
