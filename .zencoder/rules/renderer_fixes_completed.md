description: Critical fixes applied to renderer JavaScript syntax and IPC function calls

Fixed multiple JavaScript syntax errors in src/renderer/index.js:

1. **Class Structure Issues**: Moved standalone functions that used 'this' back into the WhisperWrapperApp class as proper methods. Functions affected: updateAIRefinementUIState, saveAIRefinementSettings, loadAIRefinementSettings, testOllamaConnection, refreshOllamaModels, etc.

2. **IPC Function Mismatches**: Fixed template-related function calls to match preload.js exposures:
   - Changed getTemplates() to getAllTemplates() 
   - Fixed response handling for {success: true, templates: [...]} structure
   - Replaced non-existent saveTemplates() with individual createTemplate/updateTemplate/deleteTemplate operations

3. **Export/Initialization Code**: Moved class export and DOM event listeners outside the class definition to proper location after class closes.

Build script was also updated to copy both index.js and notificationSystem.js files to dist directory.
