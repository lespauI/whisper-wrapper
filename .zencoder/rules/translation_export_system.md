Export and Session Management System for Ongoing Translation:

## UI Components Added:
- Export controls in translation display header with "Export Session" and "Save Session" buttons
- Translation export modal with format selection (SRT, TXT, JSON, CSV) and export options
- Session save modal with name/description fields and session preview
- Professional modal styling with responsive design

## Export Formats Implemented:
- **SRT Subtitles**: Standard subtitle format with timestamps for video use
- **Plain Text**: Clean text format with optional bilingual content  
- **JSON Data**: Complete session data for developers and archival
- **CSV Spreadsheet**: Tabular format for analysis and processing

## Export Options:
- Include/exclude audio files
- Include/exclude timestamps  
- Bilingual vs single language export
- Format-specific option validation (e.g., SRT always includes timestamps)

## Session Management:
- Auto-generated session names with timestamp
- Custom session naming and descriptions
- Session metadata collection (duration, languages, sentence counts)
- Local storage implementation for session persistence
- Session data collection from live translation display

## Key Features:
- Smart export option validation based on selected format
- Professional download system using Blob URLs
- Session statistics calculation and display
- Error handling with user-friendly notifications
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet use

## Architecture Pattern:
- Modal-based UI following existing app patterns
- Event-driven architecture with proper cleanup
- Data collection from DOM elements with fallback handling
- Extensible export system supporting new formats
- Clean separation between UI logic and data processing

This implementation completes Story 8 requirements for session export and storage functionality.
