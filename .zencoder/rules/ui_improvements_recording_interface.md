## UI Improvements - Recording Interface Layout

### Changes Made:
Reorganized the recording interface to optimize space utilization and improve user experience based on user feedback.

### Key Improvements:

#### 1. Input Level Indicator & Audio Visualization Repositioning
**Before**: Input level meter and audio visualization were positioned in their own full-width containers
**After**: Both moved to top-right corner as a unified floating panel

**Implementation**:
- Added `.record-main-area` wrapper with `position: relative`
- Created `.audio-corner-panel` container for both elements
- Used absolute positioning with semi-transparent backgrounds
- Added backdrop blur effect for modern glassmorphism appearance
- Shortened label from "Input Level:" to "Input:" for space efficiency
- Compact audio visualization canvas (280x80 instead of 600x120)

**CSS Features**:
```css
.audio-corner-panel {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0; right: 0;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 0.5rem;
    min-width: 300px;
}

.audio-level-corner, .record-visualization-corner {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

#### 2. Ongoing Transcription Area Enhancement
**Before**: Small transcription area with 8 rows and basic styling
**After**: Enlarged area with 12 rows and enhanced visual prominence

**Changes**:
- Increased textarea from 8 to 12 rows
- Added `.ongoing-transcription-enlarged` class for enhanced styling
- Increased min-height from 120px to 200px
- Increased max-height from 200px to 400px
- Enhanced container padding from 1.5rem to 2rem
- Improved border radius from 12px to 16px
- Enhanced box shadow for better visual depth
- Larger font size (0.9rem → 1rem) and line height (1.5 → 1.6)

**Enhanced Container Styling**:
```css
.ongoing-transcription-container {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.98);
    border-radius: 16px;
    padding: 2rem;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    min-height: 300px;
}
```

#### 3. Responsive Design Considerations
**Mobile Optimization**:
- On screens ≤768px, corner audio level reverts to static positioning
- Maintains full functionality across all screen sizes
- Preserves accessibility and usability on smaller devices

### Benefits:

#### Space Utilization:
- **Freed up significant vertical space** by moving both input level and audio visualization to corner
- **More prominent transcription** area without increasing overall interface height
- **Efficient corner usage** - both monitoring elements in compact floating panel
- **Cleaner layout** with much less visual clutter

#### User Experience:
- **Better readability** of transcription text with larger area and improved typography
- **Persistent monitoring** with corner-positioned audio level and visualization
- **Compact audio feedback** with right-sized waveform visualization
- **Modern glassmorphism** design for the floating corner panel
- **Responsive behavior** ensures functionality across devices

#### Visual Hierarchy:
- **Enhanced focus** on transcription content as primary interface element
- **Subtle but accessible** monitoring tools in unified corner panel
- **Proper information layering** - main content prominent, monitoring tools secondary
- **Improved visual depth** with enhanced shadows and backgrounds

### File Structure:
- **HTML Changes**: `/src/renderer/index.html` - Restructured recording controls and transcription textarea
- **CSS Enhancements**: `/src/renderer/styles/main.css` - Added corner positioning and enlarged transcription styles
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries for mobile compatibility

### Technical Implementation:
- **Unified corner panel** with flexbox layout for both monitoring elements
- **Absolute positioning** with proper z-index management
- **Responsive canvas sizing** - adapts to corner (280x80) vs full-width (600x120)
- **Backdrop filters** for modern glassmorphism support
- **Progressive enhancement** with fallbacks for older browsers
- **Compact visualization** with intelligent placeholder text sizing

This implementation successfully addresses the user feedback to optimize space usage while enhancing the primary transcription functionality.
